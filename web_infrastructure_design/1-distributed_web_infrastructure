Teorico:
Load-balancer:
Is a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers. Load balancers are used to increase capacity (concurrent users) and reliability of applications.
The load balancer is configured to have an active-active or active-passive setup (their choice)
The load balancer is still a single point of failure

Master Database & Secondary Database:
The MySQL Master-Replica cluster used replication to keep data synchronized
The Master database node can accept reads/writes while the Replica can only accept reads
