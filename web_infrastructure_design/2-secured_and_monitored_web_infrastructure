Teoric:
firewall:
A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and 
decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.

Secure Sockets Layer(SSL):
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), are protocols for 
establishing authenticated and encrypted links between networked computers. Although the SSL protocol was
deprecated with the release of TLS 1.0 in 1999, it is still common to refer to these.
Terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue because the traffic between the load balancer and the web servers is unencrypted

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
Is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It uses encryption for secure communication over a computer network
HTTPS is setup so that if someone intercepts the traffic, it cannot be read

Monitor:
Monitoring can be used to check if something is broken or slow in this exercise we have 2 users who are monitors
The monitoring setup is composed of a client collecting data and sending it to the monitoring system
monitoring should collect web server data and have an alert triggered if QPS is getting out of control

Database:
Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue because if the master goes down, the application cannot write to the database anymore

Servers:
Having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem because their consumption will not grow the same way between each of them (we might want to have more database servers than application servers for instance).
Having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem because when there is maintenance performed on a server for a specific component, it will affect other components that are on it

Load-balancer:
Load-balancer is a SPOF
